# Dove - Rust AMQP 1.0 Library

Dove is an open source Rust implementation of the AMQP 1.0 OASIS standard (http://www.amqp.org/). The Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP) is an open standard for passing business messages between applications or organizations.  It connects systems, feeds business processes with the information they need and reliably transmits onward the instructions that achieve their goals. 

Dove aims to be an AMQP 1.0 implementation with the following properties:

* Low footprint - efficient memory usage and pay only for what you use.
* Portable - minimize the number of dependencies and use portable APIs.

The library supports only the basics right now: Establishing connections, creating sessions, links and sending and receiving message. Most AMQP 1.0 types have been implemented, and conversion for many Rust native types exists. Support for SASL ANONYMOUS and PLAIN.

Dove exposes two different APIs:

* A low level connection API that allows you to send and receive frames defined as rust types.
* An API for writing messaging applications using async rust.

## TODO

* Allow setting more options (on container, connection, session, links)
* Cleaning up crate/module structure.
* TLS/SSL support
* Improve SASL support (missing SCRAM* support)
* Complete implementation of encoding+decoding for all AMQP 1.0 types.
* Improve test coverage.
* Make transport layer pluggable (for embedded use cases where mio is not possible).
* Compile to WASM.

## Examples

Client examples can be found in the [examples/](https://github.com/lulf/dove/tree/master/examples) directory.
